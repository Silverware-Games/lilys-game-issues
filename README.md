# Lily’s Game: Cats vs. Cows Across Space and Time

Lily’s Game is a playful, surreal anthology of mini-games that together tell an ongoing story about cats fighting cows across time, space, and reality itself.

Each level is a self-contained mechanic with its own rules, tone, and aesthetic — but all levels contribute to a larger narrative arc about conflict, consequence, and cosmic absurdity.

This README functions as both a lightweight design document and an onboarding guide for contributors.

## High-Level Vision

Lily’s Game is:

- An anthology game (multiple short games, one universe)
- Mechanically experimental (each level explores a different genre or core mechanic)
- Narrative-connected, not narrative-heavy
- Humorous, strange, and occasionally philosophical

Think:

- WarioWare-style variety
- Narrative consequence without long cutscenes
- Indie cartoon energy that knows it’s a game

Cats and cows are not just characters — they are forces, roles, and sometimes metaphors.

## Core Design Pillars

### 1. Mini-Games as Story Beats

Each level:

- Has a single primary mechanic
- Can be understood in seconds
- Represents a moment in the cats vs. cows conflict

### 2. Mechanics First, Lore Second

- Gameplay should stand on its own
- Story emerges from player behavior, not exposition

### 3. Consequence Without Traditional Failure

- Player performance changes the narrative
- Poor performance does not end the game — it redirects it

### 4. Playful Absurdity

- The game embraces nonsense, surreal logic, and genre shifts
- Emotional or philosophical ideas are allowed, but never treated too seriously

## Ongoing Check-Ins & Narrative Evolution

Throughout the anthology, the game performs periodic **check-ins**.

These moments:

- Reveal stats and summaries of how the player has been performing
- Recontextualize earlier events
- Influence future levels, tone, or narrative framing

Examples of tracked behaviors:

- How often the player is hit by cow lasers
- How quickly or efficiently levels are completed
- Whether puzzles are solved cleanly or messily
- Patterns of hesitation, aggression, or precision

These stats do not judge the player — they *interpret* them.

The story adapts based on what actually happened, not on binary success or failure.

## Current Levels

### Level 1: Slingshot the Cat

**Genre:** Physics / Skill

**Core Mechanic:**

- Launch a cat via slingshot toward a cow
- Aim, power, and trajectory determine the outcome

**Design Goals:**

- Immediate, tactile fun
- Clear cause-and-effect
- A strong mechanical introduction

**Narrative Role:**

- The opening confrontation
- Establishes cats as active agents

### Level 2: Diamond Shield Laser Deflection

**Genre:** Reflex / Timing

**Core Mechanic:**

- Cows fire lasers
- Player positions or rotates a diamond shield to deflect them

**Design Goals:**

- Precision and rhythm
- Escalating intensity
- Strong visual readability

**Narrative Role:**

- Cows escalate technologically
- Cats adapt defensively rather than offensively

### Level 3: Haystack Guessing Game

**Genre:** Deduction / Memory

**Core Mechanic:**

- Cows hide among haystacks
- Player must determine where they are hiding

**Design Goals:**

- Tension through uncertainty
- Pattern recognition
- Subtle manipulation of player expectations

**Narrative Role:**

- Information warfare
- Truth obscured by abundance

### Level 4: Crate-Pushing Maze

**Genre:** Puzzle (Sokoban-like)

**Core Mechanic:**

- Push crates to trap cows within a confined maze

**Design Goals:**

- Thoughtful pacing
- Spatial reasoning
- Efficiency rewarded, not required

**Narrative Role:**

- Control through systems
- The cost of containment

## Planned Level: Heaven & Hell

**Genre:** Outcome-Based Narrative Split

**Concept:**

- Player performance across prior levels determines which path they enter

**Heaven:**

- You make money
- Abundance and surplus
- Comfort with hidden trade-offs

**Hell:**

- You accumulate debt
- Scarcity and obligation
- Systems that persist and compound

This is not a moral judgment.  
It is a reflection of how the player moved through the game.

Both outcomes are intended to be fully playable and meaningful.

## Anthology Structure

- Levels can be played in sequence (story mode)
- Levels can also be played individually
- Some levels may return later with altered rules or context
- Repetition is allowed — context changes meaning

## Tech & Architecture (High-Level)

The game is in Javascript HTML5 and easy to work on/add levels and so on.

This structure supports:

- Rapid prototyping
- Experimental mechanics
- Easy onboarding for contributors

## How to Contribute

We welcome:

- Game designers
- Programmers
- Artists and animators
- Sound designers
- Writers interested in implicit storytelling

Ways to contribute:

- Propose a new mini-game
- Improve or extend an existing level
- Add polish, accessibility, or juice
- Help define how stats and narrative interpretation evolve

If you can explain why a mechanic belongs in this universe, it probably does.

## Design Philosophy (TL;DR)

- Short games, big ideas
- Player behavior is the story
- Failure is just another data point
- Cats and cows are eternal

## Project Status

Lily’s Game is actively evolving.

Expect:

- Iteration
- Weird ideas
- Design discussions in public

This is a living anthology, and this README will evolve with it.
